# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing the guarantee cards and invitation cards to reflect professional agency-quality design standards.

2. WHEN a user hovers over guarantee cards THEN the cards SHALL provide subtle, elegant interactive feedback without being distracting

4. WHEN guarantee cards are viewed on different devices THEN they SHALL maintain their sophisticated appearance across all screen sizes

3. WHEN users navigate between different sections THEN the card designs SHALL feel like part of a unified, professional design system
4. WHEN cards are viewed THEN they SHALL enhance rather than detract from the overall site's premium positioning

### Requirement 4
