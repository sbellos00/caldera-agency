# Design Document

## Overview

This design modernizes the guarantee cards and invitation cards to reflect premium agency-quality standards. The approach focuses on sophisticated visual hierarchy, refined micro-interactions, and elevated design details that demonstrate professional expertise while maintaining consistency with the existing design system.

## Architecture

### Design System Integration
- Leverage existing color palette: `--primary-blue (#0019ff)`, `--blue-light (#E6E9FF)`, `--gray-medium (#6B6B6B)`, `--black (#000000)`, `--cream (#f1efe7)`
- Maintain current spacing and typography scales
- Enhance existing interaction patterns with more sophisticated animations
- Preserve accessibility standards and responsive behavior

### Visual Hierarchy Enhancement
- Implement advanced layering with subtle depth cues
- Use refined typography scales with improved letter-spacing and line-height
- Apply sophisticated color relationships and contrast ratios
- Create visual flow through strategic use of whitespace and alignment

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Guarantee Cards

#### Visual Design
- **Background Treatment**: Multi-layered background with subtle texture overlay and gradient borders
- **Typography**: Refined font weights and spacing for premium feel
- **Iconography**: Custom-styled SVG icons with sophisticated hover states
- **Layout**: Improved spacing hierarchy and content organization

#### Interactive Elements
- **Hover States**: Smooth elevation changes with sophisticated shadow systems
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle scale transforms and opacity transitions
- **Border Effects**: Dynamic gradient borders that respond to mouse position
- **Content Reveals**: Progressive disclosure of additional details on interaction

#### Technical Implementation
```css
.guarantee-card-modern {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.95) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0.85) 100%);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 25, 255, 0.08);
  box-shadow: 
    0 4px 24px rgba(0, 25, 255, 0.04),
    0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02),
    inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
}
```

### Refined Invitation Cards

#### Visual Design
- **Card Container**: Sophisticated border treatment with animated gradient effects
- **Content Layout**: Improved information hierarchy with strategic use of visual weight
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced list items with refined hover states
- **Bonus Items**: Distinguished styling that creates clear value perception

#### Micro-interactions
- **Staggered Animations**: Sequential reveal of list items for engaging experience
- **Hover Feedback**: Subtle transforms and color transitions
- **Focus States**: Clear accessibility indicators with elegant styling
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions for dynamic content

#### Technical Implementation
```css
.invitation-card-modern {
  position: relative;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.92);
  backdrop-filter: blur(24px);
  border-radius: 24px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 25, 255, 0.06);
  box-shadow: 
    0 8px 32px rgba(0, 25, 255, 0.06),
    0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02);
}
```

## Data Models

### Card Configuration
```typescript
interface CardConfig {
  variant: 'guarantee' | 'invitation';
  theme: 'light' | 'premium';
  animations: {
    enabled: boolean;
    duration: number;
    easing: string;
  };
  interactions: {
    hover: boolean;
    focus: boolean;
    mouseTracking: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Animation States
```typescript
interface AnimationState {
  isHovered: boolean;
  isPressed: boolean;
  isFocused: boolean;
  mousePosition: { x: number; y: number };
  animationPhase: 'idle' | 'entering' | 'active' | 'exiting';
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Fallback styles for browsers without backdrop-filter support
- Reduced motion preferences respected for accessibility
- Progressive enhancement for advanced visual effects
- Fallback animations for older browsers

### Performance Considerations
- CSS transforms over layout-triggering properties
- Hardware acceleration for smooth animations
- Debounced mouse tracking for performance
- Efficient selector usage to minimize repaints

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons across different viewport sizes
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- High contrast mode verification
- Print stylesheet validation

### Interaction Testing
- Hover state functionality across devices
- Keyboard navigation accessibility
- Touch interaction on mobile devices
- Animation performance under load

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratio validation
- Focus indicator visibility
- Reduced motion preference handling

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Update CSS custom properties for enhanced color system
- Implement base card structure with improved layout
- Add sophisticated background treatments and borders

### Phase 2: Interactions
- Implement advanced hover states and micro-animations
- Add mouse tracking for dynamic gradient effects
- Create smooth transition systems

### Phase 3: Polish
- Fine-tune animation timing and easing curves
- Optimize performance and accessibility
- Add progressive enhancement features

### Design Principles

#### Sophistication Through Restraint
