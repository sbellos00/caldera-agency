## **Why We Exist**

Caldera exists for one reason: to build high quality websites for consultants that need them. Nothing else. We cut out the chaos, the admin, and the generic agency playbook. Every part of our process is designed so that clients get a site that wins higher-value clients with zero wasted time.

## **What Makes Our Process Different**

- **Consultants only. No distractions, no dilution.**
    
    We don’t take on projects for agencies, local businesses, or e-commerce. Everything we do is built around what matters most for solo consultants: establishing credibility, driving high-value inbound, and freeing you from project headaches and admin bloat.
    
- **No busywork, ever.**
    
    We research your background and consulting market before you see a single question. No generic forms or open-ended guesswork.
    
- **Clear, structured feedback.**
    
    Each review round is focused, with our guidance on what to check and how to comment.
    
- **Milestone payments, always in your control.**
    
    You approve each phase before paying. You never risk being left with a half-finished website.
    
- **We handle everything after.**
    
    Launch, domain, analytics, hosting, tech support, and post-launch tweaks are all managed by us so you can stay focused on your work.
    
- **Full ownership, zero lock-in.**
    
    You own your website, domain, and content 100%. Move, host, or upgrade anytime.
