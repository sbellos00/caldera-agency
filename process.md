## **Our Process: Step-by-Step**

Here's exactly how your custom website project unfolds—clear, easy, and fully guided at every step:

### **1. We do the research (Zero busywork for you)**

Before you see a single question, we research your LinkedIn, existing website, and published content to:

- Prefill your details, saving you time
- Craft precise, targeted multiple-choice questions to helps us nail your unique value proposition and positioning
- Ensure maximum accuracy and relevance from day one

**Outcome:** Intake is fast, focused, and effortless.

### **2. Quick, targeted intake form (~10 min)**

You complete a short, custom-built form:

- Confirm pre-filled info (name, title, experience)
- Choose from tailored options about your services, differentiators, and client pain points
- Select visual preferences from handpicked examples (no abstract choices)
- Upload logos, branding, or use professional placeholders we provide

**Outcome:** We build the foundation for all the structure, copy, and design decisions that follow.

We design a best-fit homepage structure and style, plus two custom alternatives.
