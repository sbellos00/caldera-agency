Q: “What if I don’t have time for a big project?”
A: “We’ve designed our process to be incredibly efficient. We handle all the technical and creative work, requiring less than two hours of your time to get everything launched.”

Q: “I was burned by agencies/freelancers before.”
A: “We understand your hesitation. That’s why we operate with complete transparency. Our process is broken down into clear milestones, and you only pay for each stage after you have reviewed and approved the work.”

Q: “What if you’re late?”
A: “If your site isn’t live in 20 days (assuming you provide what’s needed), we pay you back 20% per business day late. Guaranteed.”

Q: “What if I’m not happy at launch?”
A: “You only pay for each phase after you approve it. Final payment is only due if you’re proud to launch—no risk of paying for something you can’t use.”

Q: “Who owns the site?”
A: “You own it, fully. No platform risk, no lock-in. We provide hosting, support, and maintenance to make your life easier, but you can take the full code and self-host anytime you wish."

Q: “What if I need updates later?”
A: "Up to 4 post-launch development hours are included for free during the first month with your hosting plan, then 2 hours per month thereafter. Anything more is handled quickly by us at our standard rate."

Q: “Do you build for other industries?”
A: “No. Consultants only. That’s why our sites work.”

Q: “Isn’t this just another template site?”
A: "No. Every step is research-based and guides us towards designing the perfect website for you from scratch. All design and copy is consultant-specific and tailored to your positioning, built for consulting credibility—never generic."

Q: “Why not just do it myself?”
A: “We do all the heavy lifting so you don’t waste weeks of your time. One new client covers your investment.”

Q: “Will this bring leads?”
A: “No site guarantees leads. But without credibility, you lose by default. This site is built to open doors to RFPs, partnerships, and high-value deals.”

Q: “LinkedIn works for me now.”
A: “LinkedIn is just one platform. A professional website gives you full control over your digital presence, establishes deeper credibility, and positions you at a higher tier than competitors who rely solely on social media. Don’t risk being at the mercy of algorithms and sudden policy changes.”
