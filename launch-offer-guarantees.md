## **Our Quality Commitment Guarantee**

We believe you should only pay for work you’re genuinely proud to launch. Here’s how our process puts you in control:

- **Pay only for delivered work.**
    
    You pay for each phase as it’s completed, never for empty promises, never for work you haven’t seen and approved.
    
- **Full transparency at every stage.**
    
    You review and sign off before moving to the next phase. If you’re not satisfied at any stage (after homepage, or before launch), you can pause the project with no further obligation.
    
- **Final payment, only if you’re proud to launch.**
    
    The last invoice is due only when your website is fully delivered and you’re confident putting it in front of your best clients and prospects.
    
- **No fine print, no loopholes, no games.**
    
    Our guarantee is built into our process: total clarity, milestone payments, and real, reviewable results—every step of the way.
    

## **20-Day Launch Guarantee**

You choose us because you want speed and certainty, not agency delays or excuses. If you provide everything we request on time, we guarantee your site goes live in 20 days or less.

If we miss the deadline for reasons on our end, we’ll pay you back **20% of your project fee for every business day we’re late.** No hassle, no excuses.

**You can plan your launch with total confidence. If we slip, you get paid for the delay.**

- The 20-day guarantee assumes prompt client responses, timely feedback, and on-time asset delivery. Full details provided in your onboarding pack.
